# DistAssign1GroupChat
Sabesan Sivakumar 100701928
For my assignment I decided to create a group chat application. 
In my application the clients will be prompted to enter a username and once they enter a username on the server side it will acknowledge that a client has entered the chat and display its IP address. 
Since we are using the same local host and each client is running the same java file they would all have the same IP address.
Once 2 or more clients have connected and it shows on the server side that they have the clients now can chat with eachother.
To chat with eachother the client will just write their message and press enter to send. 
On the other clients side it will display the clients username and message.
TO end the application once one client leaves the server will close.
To run the application all you have to do so go to the src directory compile all the java files "javac *.java" than run the server first "java Server.java" and than run the Clients "Java Client.java" the ClientHandler.java does not need to be run.
